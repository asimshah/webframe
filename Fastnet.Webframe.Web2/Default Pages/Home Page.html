    <h2>
        Welcome to your new Webframe site
    </h2>
    <p>
        This home, or “landing page”, has been set up for you by
        default when the site was created. It can be found in the root folder of the site's content storage, or “Store”.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page also has content in two of the available “side” panels: the banner and the left panel -
        the right panel has been turned off.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Customising your site
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can customise the site by editing these pages and creating additional pages that can be hyperlinked. You can also make changes
        to the look of the site by editing the css used for each of the panels and you can create menus.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            <small>You need to be both logged in and be a member of the requisite group to make these changes:</small>
        </i>
        <ul>
            <li><i><small>Members of the Designers group can change the look of the site by modifying css. They can also create and edit menus.</small></i></li>
            <li><i><small>Members who have edit rights on a folder can create and edit pages in that folder. The Editors group has edit rights on all folders (by default).</small></i></li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
        <i>The Administrator is always a member of both groups.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        This initial version of the site has a menu which can be seen above - use the login button to login (using initially, at least,
        the administrators credentials). An additional menu item will then provide access to the Designer and the membership apps.
    </p>
    <p>As an example, a side menu is available in left panel - all its items are only available when logged in.</p>
